A program/script that pulls statistics from players’ profiles of any searchable player on the game League of Legends. These players can be searched on this program/script and their statistics will be output to a excel file or database. If their profile is private, “private” should be displayed, if the profile is public, the statistics be deposited into the database.

The project I envision is a program that scrapes the players' statistics and outputs that into a database that is easily viewable and sortable. We plan to scape specific player’s data to analyze. So, we want to extract as much statistics as possible on the profile. I have outlined all the ones that we need, but if you can, we would like ALL the data possible on that player for all game modes.

Finally, after we turn on the program, we expect it to run without stopping. We want to be able to view the new data by different intervals meaning by seasons, weeks, days, and in real-time.

However, this database needs to be able to be viewed online and through a excel like file.

The statistics pull must update in real time or to a very short time interval.
